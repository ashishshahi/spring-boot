DTO is an abbreviation for Data Transfer Object, so it is used to transfer the data between classes and modules of your application.
* DTO should only contain private fields for your data, getters, setters, and constructors.
* DTO is not recommended to add business logic methods to such classes, but it is OK to add some util methods.


We avoid exposing the real object to the client/user so we take input in DTO and out in DTO
