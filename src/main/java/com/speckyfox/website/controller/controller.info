We will create controllers here.

* One type of controllers should be grouped in one package and other type in another package.
* controller that simply return or render a page like get login page/screen should be name like "getLoginScreen"
* And, controller that does validate the login request could name as "validateLogin"
* In case of any confusion of the naming convention reach out to Abhishek
